# TODO

- Implement 2D slice Monte Carlo: circles with varying radii from 3D sphere slicing, ray tracing, validate against 3D analytical formula.
- Scan parameters of geometry and produce summary plots.
- Use distribution sigma for MC error bars in scan plots (from `plots/geometry/distributions_2d`).
- Validation of MC simulation for electrons on slab (reproduce existing SEE data).
- Full MC simulation of MIP detection including electron multiplication (no backscattering; all electrons absorbed in shell; electric field histogram from Comsol; geometrical mean free path histogram).
- Check plot with one curve per parameter vs thickness.
