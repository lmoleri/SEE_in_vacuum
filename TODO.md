# TODO

- Validation of MC simulation for electrons on slab (reproduce existing SEE data).
- Full MC simulation of MIP detection including electron multiplication (no backscattering; all electrons absorbed in shell; electric field histogram from Comsol; geometrical mean free path histogram).
- Move all python scripts into a dedicated folder.
- Reorganize Python scripts with proper documentation (clear structure, purpose, inputs/outputs, and usage examples for each script).
- Verify attenuation factor in depth-weighted model: current attenuation over 5 nm appears too small (~10%); check against thickness dependence in data, which suggests saturation beyond about 5 nm.
